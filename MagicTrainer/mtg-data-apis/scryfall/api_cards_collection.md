# POST /cards/collection

Rate limit: 2/second (500ms)

Supported formats: `json`

Accepts a JSON array of [card identifiers](#card-identifiers),
and returns a [List object](/docs/api/lists)
with the collection of requested cards. A maximum of
75 card references may be
submitted per request. The request must be posted
with `Content-Type` as `application/json`.

| Parameter | Type | Atn | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `identifiers` | Array |  | An array of JSON objects, each one a [card identifier](#card-identifiers). |
| `pretty` | Boolean | Optional | If true, the returned JSON will be prettified. Avoid using for production code. |

## Card Identifiers

Each submitted card identifier must be a JSON object with one or more
of the keys `id`, `mtgo_id`, `multiverse_id`, `oracle_id`, `illustration_id`, `name`, `set`, and `collector_number`.
The following combinations are valid identifier schemas:

Schema | Format | Description || `id` | UUID | Finds a card with the specified Scryfall `id`. |
| `mtgo_id` | Integer | Finds a card with the specified `mtgo_id` or `mtgo_foil_id`. |
| `multiverse_id` | Integer | Finds a card with the specified value among its `multiverse_ids`. |
| `oracle_id` | UUID | Finds the newest edition of cards with the specified `oracle_id`. |
| `illustration_id` | UUID | Finds the preferred scans of cards with the specified `illustration_id`. |
| `name` | String | Finds the newest edition of a card with the specified `name`. |
| `name,set` | Strings | Finds a card matching the specified `name` and `set`. |
| `collector_number,set` | Strings | Finds a card with the specified `collector_number` and `set`. Note that collector numbers are *strings*. |

Multiple identifier schemas may be included in a single request.
Each identifier will return up to one card. Identifiers
that are not found will be returned in the `not_found`
array. While cards will be returned in the order that they were
requested, cards that aren’t found will throw off the mapping
of request identifiers to results, so you should not
rely on positional index alone while parsing the data.
