# API Documentation

Scryfall provides a REST-like API for ingesting our card data programmatically.
The API exposes information available on the regular site
in easy-to-consume formats.

## Endpoint Details

The API is available at `https://api.scryfall.com`

API requests are only served over HTTPS, using TLS 1.2 or better.
Requests will not be honored over plaintext HTTP.

The API uses UTF-8 character encoding for all responses.
Many fields will include characters that are not in the ASCII range.

Endpoints (especially for card data) have specific hard [rate limits](/docs/api/rate-limits).

## Required Headers

All HTTP requests to `api.scryfall.com` must include a `User-Agent` header
and an `Accept` header.

Your `User-Agent` header must be accurate to your usage context.
If you are running a script or app, the header should
be the name of your application, such as `MTGExampleApp/1.0` or the current
relevant version. Do not allow HTTP libraries to choose the header for you.

If you are accessing the API via on-page web browser JavaScript,
keep the browser’s `User-Agent` intact.

The `Accept` header must be present, but you can provide a generic preference.
For example, both of these are okay: `Accept: */*` and `Accept: application/json;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8`.

## Use of Scryfall Data and Images

As part of the [Wizards of the Coast Fan Content Policy](https://company.wizards.com/fancontentpolicy),
Scryfall provides our card data and image database free of charge for the primary
purpose of creating additional *Magic* software, performing research,
or creating community content (such as videos, streams, podcasts, etc.)
about *Magic* and related products.

When using Scryfall data, you must adhere to the following guidelines:

* You may not use Scryfall logos or use the Scryfall name in a way
  that implies Scryfall has endorsed you, your work, or your product.
* You may not “paywall” access to Scryfall data.
  You may not require anyone to make payments, take surveys, agree to subscriptions,
  rate your content, join chat servers, or follow channels in exchange for access to Scryfall data.
  If you have an account system, end-users should be able to access card data anonymously or with free accounts.
* You may not use Scryfall data to create new games, or
  to imply the information and images are from any other game besides *Magic: The Gathering*.
* You may not simply repackage, republish, or proxy Scryfall data.
  Your software must create additional value for end-users.

When using images from Scryfall, you must adhere to the following guidelines:

* **Do not** cover, crop, or clip off the copyright or artist name on card images.
* **Do not** distort, skew, or stretch card images.
* **Do not** blur, sharpen, desaturate, or color-shift card images.
* **Do not** add your own watermarks, stamps, or logos to card images.
* **Do not** place card images in a way that implies someone other than Wizards of the
  Coast created the card or that it is from another game besides *Magic: The Gathering*.
* When using the `art_crop`,
  list the artist name and copyright elsewhere in the same interface presenting
  the art crop, or use the full card image elsewhere in the same interface.
  Users should be able to identify the artist and source of the image somehow.

Repeated mishandling or misrepresentation of data or images in your project
may result in Scryfall restricting or blocking your API access.
